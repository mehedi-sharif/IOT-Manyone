Administrators have access to the **Application Access Management** (AAM). 
It is necessary to enable apps to directly connect via CMO API / DMO API or both.
Click on **Add new application.** In the window that opens an application name must be given, and the e-mail-address of the responsible contact needs to be added.

For the connectivity management there is the option to grant **CMO read** and **CMO write** access. These settings can be updated at any given time.

After adding the application successfully, the administrator / user can directly see the **Client ID** and **Client secret**. Both are necessary for application authentications.

Applications that were successfully added to the Application Access Management will be listed. With a click on the application name the application details can be read and edited.
It is also possible to add new credentials, either substituting the current credentials via the 

**Refresh secret** function or adding new credentials for additional access.


> **Please note:** Once credentials are refreshed all apps that use these credentials, lose their direct access and need to be updated.
