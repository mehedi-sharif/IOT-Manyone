Device management is a framework to simplify the control of connected IoT devices. It involves the registration, configuration, grouping, monitoring, and maintenance of devices throughout their lifecycle. 

# How Device Management works

Here are some key aspects of device management:

1. **Registration:** Device registration allows you to onboard new IoT devices. During registration, devices are assigned unique identifiers and associated with your account. This enables the platform to recognize and track each device's status and communication.
2. **Activation/Deactivation:** Once registered, devices need to be activated to establish connectivity and start transmitting data. Device activation involves configuring network settings, provisioning security credentials, and ensuring proper communication with the IoT Hub platform. Conversely, device deactivation suspends connectivity for devices that are no longer in use or require temporary disconnection.
3. **Monitoring and Status:** The IoT Hub platform provides real-time monitoring capabilities to track the status and health of devices. You can monitor key parameters such as device connectivity, data transmission, signal strength, and battery level. This allows you to proactively identify and resolve issues, ensuring the smooth operation of your IoT deployments
4. **Group Creation:** Organizes and manages devices with common characteristics or functionalities. Device groups can be based on location, device type, customer, or any other criteria that suit your requirements. Group creation involves selecting devices and assigning them to specific groups.
