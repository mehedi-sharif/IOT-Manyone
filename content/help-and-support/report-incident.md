The helpdesk is the most efficient way to get support from our team. 
You can access **Help & Support** directly from the T IoT Hub dashboard. Click on “**Report** [****](https://myiot-r.com/ufe/support)**incidents to the helpdesk**” if you want to report an issue by opening a helpdesk ticket.

You can also start this process from other areas of the user interface, for example, by selecting a SIM in the **SIM overview** and then clicking Report issue.
In this case, some fields will be pre-populated automatically based on your selection to make it quicker to complete the helpdesk ticket.


1. **Personal Data & Issue Type**

The first step in the ticket creation process is to select the issue type.
Available issue types are:

    - Connectivity
    - Billing / Reporting
    - API / Portal

With each ticket, information about the person opening the ticket gets submitted. Edit your personal information in account settings.
