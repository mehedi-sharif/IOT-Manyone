If the tenant is set up to use compatible connectivity platforms, the T IoT Hub can provide the customer with access to reports that are generated from raw data collected from one or more of these platforms. These reports are aggregated via the T IoT Hub for the customer’s convenience. 


- **Please note:** Global Usage Reports are available as an optional feature. After opting into Global Usage Reports, reports of the last 6 months can be downloaded locally as a CSV file. The reports can be found in the Connectivity Management under the ‘Reports’ page.
