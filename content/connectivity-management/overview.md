- MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number)
- Serial number

By presenting this information in a clear and organised manner, the Connectivity Management App aims to streamline the process of managing connectivity and enable users to access the information they need to make informed decisions. 

The page immediately loads currently available data of all connected platforms.
To load more products, click the button at the bottom of the page.


> **Please note:** Your companyâ€™s administrator has to setup one or several platforms.



## Product Status

Depending on the platform, different statuses of the product are available. The user can actively switch between these:

- **Active**

- **Terminated** (TMSP only)
- **Pending terminate** (TMUS only)

The overview also shows passive statuses for information only such as:

- Created
- Pending active
- Terminated


> **Please note:** T IoT Hub uses standardised status names, as all platforms differ, and the goal is to have a uniform view.



## Status Mapping Table

As the T IoT Hub uses standardised status names, a helpful mapping table can be accessed clicking the **?** icon beside the **Status** column.
