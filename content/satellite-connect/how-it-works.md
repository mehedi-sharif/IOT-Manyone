Combining cellular and satellite networks ensures continuous and reliable connectivity for IoT devices. Allowing them to seamlessly switch between cellular and satellite networks based on coverage availability and cost efficiency. 
What do we mean by each of these?

**Cellular Connectivity:** IoT devices initially connect to cellular network where coverage is available, as it is the most economic option. Depending on the device and network availability, a connection can be through technologies like 2G, 3G, 4G LTE, or 5G. 

**Cellular Network Communication:** IoT devices communicate with the nearest cellular base stations to send and receive data. This action allows devices to benefit from the widespread coverage and high-speed data transmission capabilities of cellular networks in areas where they are available.

**Integration with** **Satellite and** **Cellular Network****s****:** The hybrid solution seamlessly integrates satellite connectivity in areas where cellular coverage is limited or nonexistent. When IoT devices move outside cellular coverage, they automatically switch to satellite connectivity to maintain continuous communication.

**Satellite Modems/Terminals:** IoT devices connect to satellite modems, which act as gateways between the devices and the satellite network. They facilitate data transmission to and from the satellite network, using wireless protocols compatible with satellite communication.

**Satellite Communication:** The satellite modem/terminal sends data to the satellite network, relaying it to the ground station. Deutsche Telekom's infrastructure is connected to the ground station.

**Data Routing and Processing:** The integrated data routes to the T IoT Hub platform. Here it undergoes processing, storage, and management similar to data from purely cellular-connected devices.
