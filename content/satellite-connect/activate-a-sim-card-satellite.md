> **Note:** To enable satellite connectivity, it's necessary to have the satellite set to "active."


5. You can check and see if your **SIM card** was activated both in the detailed view, and the list view. Your **SIM card** or **Satellite** should now say “active” in the status.

> **Note:** If your status says **“Pending Active”** you may be on a system operating asynchronously. Which means it will activate following your system's rules for operations.
