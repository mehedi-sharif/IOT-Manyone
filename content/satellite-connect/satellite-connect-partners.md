Initial partners are collaborating with Deutsche Telekom for more broadband applications and narrowband devices via satellite. 

**Intelsat** is a leading operator of satellite services with global coverage. The partnership with Intelsat enables Deutsche Telekom's T IoT Hub customers to use a global satellite infrastructure directly and form a crucial non-terrestrial building block for Deutsche Telekom's network of networks.

**Early Adopter Program (coming soon)**
**Skylo** opens convergent cellular devices for companies for their IoT applications for the first time. Thanks to new "direct-to-device" 5G NTN (non-terrestrial networks) technology standards (3GPP Rel. 17), certified NB (narrowband) IoT-capable devices or modules will also connect to the satellite network without needing any extra hardware.
