When you subscribe to Satellite Connect service, Deutsche Telekom automatically identifies and displays the list of devices you have connected. This ensures that you have visibility and control over your connected devices in a seamless way.

Within the Connectivity Management page, you will find an overview of the devices that are connected. This allows you to easily monitor and define the connectivity rules of those devices from one place. 


## Create a group

To enable Satellite Connect, you must define groups consisting of a router, satellite, and cellular systems that work together. This configuration ensures optimized connectivity for your devices. 

An assigned router takes on the role of monitoring the quality of connectivity in real time. It intelligently manages the switch between Satellite and Cellular connections based on the priority rules you establish. This means that the system will automatically switch to the most suitable connection option, ensuring reliable and uninterrupted connectivity for your devices. 


1. Select one Satellite product and one Cellular product

You have the freedom to customize the prioritization based on your needs, ensuring that the most suitable connection is utilized for optimal performance and cost efficiency. Typically, the primary system chosen is Cellular for cost optimization, while the secondary system is Satellite to avoid connectivity interruptions. 


8. Click on the bars to select the criteria for the switch. They represent the quality of the connectivity. If the quality is below the number you configure, the router will switch from your primary to your secondary connectivity system
