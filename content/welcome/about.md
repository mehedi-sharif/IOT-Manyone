T IoT Hub cuts through the complexity of deploying IoT solutions and unleashes the potential of your data in the easiest way possible. 

It solves a critical challenge: making systems of many different producers communicate with one another.  It works as a connector and translator for many partners, network operators and platform providers to bring your systems together into a functioning whole. 

T IoT Hub also offers application programming interfaces (APIs) to orchestrate a wide range of IoT connectivity and device management platforms for mobile and stationary devices.

## Examples of uses

Deutsche Telekom's T IoT Hub offers a range of use cases across various industries. Here are some examples:

**Automotive Connectivity**
Connecting vehicles deployed internationally can require automotive OEMs to work with local network operators for regulatory reasons, depending on the country. Since permanent roaming is not permitted in every country, local network providers must be integrated into the solution.

**Smart** **Metering**
Utility providers which roll out smart meters in large numbers need a fully automated workflow to activate a large set of SIMs at the time of delivery and to monitor their status. They also need to constantly keep track of data consumption and performance, even across multiple subsidiaries. This is made possible by the T IoT Hub.

**Critical infrastructure**
Critical infrastructures, such as wind farms, must be connected to the mobile network at all times. This is the only way to detect irregularities in a timely manner. Operators therefore need real-time visibility into whether SIM cards are online or offline â€“ regardless of the SIM provider.
