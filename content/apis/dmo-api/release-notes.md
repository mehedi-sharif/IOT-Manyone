# Release notes

The DMO API is versioned. 
When a new version of DMO API is released, all customers will be notified by email. 
The old version will still be supported. This means that all customers have time to upgrade to a new DMO API version. 

Up to 3 versions are supported simultaneously (2 obsolete versions and 1 current latest version). After a new version is released, the oldest of the last 4 versions will be removed from support. Customers will also be notified of this action. 

A new DMO API version is created at least when there is a need to implement a breaking change for the current version. If new features do not break the current behavior of the current version, they will be added to the current version.
