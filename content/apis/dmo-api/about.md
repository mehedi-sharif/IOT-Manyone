# About

The Device Management Orchestrator API (DMO API) can be used as a generic interoperability layer to integrate different devices, applications, and platforms. DMO provides the core functionality. Currently, the required adapters for other device management platforms will need to be developed by partners or customers.

A sample adapter is available for Nokia Impact for UDP and LwM2M devices. It allows the DMO API to be used for provisioning and automatic data collection for UDP and LwM2M (via DT IoT connectivity).


> **Note**: The Connection Management Orchestrator API (CMO API) is an optional service and is not included with IoT Hub by default. It is currently available for evaluation upon request.
