The DMO API documentation is currently available in Swagger, an open-source software framework that allows developers to access RESTful APIs in a machine-readable format. 

It provides a structured and standardized way to document APIs, making it easier for developers to understand and integrate with the API. 

The documentation includes details about the available endpoints, request/response formats, parameters, authentication methods, error handling, and other relevant information.
