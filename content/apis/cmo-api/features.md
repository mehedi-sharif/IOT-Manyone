| Create customer attribute for a SIM card subproduct      | CMO API allows clients to add custom properties to the individual SIM Card products. Properties are defined as pair of name and value and both can be defined by the API client. The information is stored locally in CMO only and it is independent of the backend system that manages the product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Jasper<br>TMUS ICC                                                      |
