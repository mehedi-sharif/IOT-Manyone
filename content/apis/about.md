Welcome to T IoT Hub, a cutting-edge platform that opens up possibilities for developers seeking to harness the power of the Internet of Things (IoT). Our platform provides seamless integration with two powerful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), empowering you to interact with the T IoT Hub and seamlessly integrate your applications with IoT functionality.


## How the CMO and DMO API works

**Connectivity Management Orchestrator (CMO) API:** Empowers you to take control of your IoT devices' connectivity settings. With this API, you can easily manage activation, suspension, and modification. It provides a flexible solution to tailor connectivity to your specific requirements.

**Device Management Orchestrator (DMO) API:** Facilitates seamless data exchange between IoT applications. It allows you to implement various use cases, including connectivity group management and collection of satellite metrics. By leveraging the DMO API, you can enable smooth communication and collaboration among your IoT applications.


## Examples of uses

**Automation:** Automated configuration of IoT devices. Instead of manually configuring each device individually. APIs enable you to apply configurations in a systematic and efficient manner. This saves time, reduces human error, and simplifies the deployment process.

**Scalability:** With APIs, you can configure a large number of devices simultaneously or in a batch. This scalability is crucial when dealing with IoT deployments that involve hundreds or thousands of devices. APIs streamline the configuration process, ensuring consistent settings across the entire fleet of devices.

**Remote Configuration:** Configuration of IoT devices over a network connection. This eliminates the need for physical access to each device, making it feasible to configure devices deployed in remote or inaccessible locations. It reduces costs associated with on-site visits and enables updates or changes when needed.
